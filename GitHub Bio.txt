My name is Khanh Trinh, however, I preferred to be call William. 
I like creating small app project and reading novel for a long period of time. 
I lived in Seattle for the past 15 years of my life along with most of my family members. 
I have a vast experience despite being in my young adult life. I did considered going through Public Health Field before heading to Informational Technical Field.
