My name is Khanh Trinh, however, I preferred to be call William. I like creating small app project and reading novel for a long period of time. I lived in Seattle for the past 15 years of my life along with most of my family members. I am a dog owner and a grand fish owner. I have a pond and 2 fish tanks with many long battle of survival history. I have a vast experience despite being in my young adult life. I did considered going through Public Health Field before heading to Informational Technical Field. I have also get a chance to speak in the Legislative Building in Olympia as a student senator. I love to understand how computer work and how the internal program work in general.
